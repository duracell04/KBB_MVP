# Architecture Overview (placeholder)

**Intent:** Explain "bank-settled, token-registered" model at a glance.  
**Why:** Align legal/ops/tech stakeholders on roles, sources of truth, and event flows.

Sections to add:
- Context & principles
- Sequence (subscription funding -> DvP -> coupon/redemption)
- Roles (issuer, transfer agent, registrar, paying agent, bank)
- Observability (bank MsgId/UETR <-> on-chain event IDs)
