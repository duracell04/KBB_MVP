# KBB_MVP — Token-registered private debt, cash-settled on regulated rails (MVP)
[![Build](https://github.com/duracell04/KBB_MVP/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/duracell04/KBB_MVP/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

**Keywords:** tokenized securities, private debt, DvP, ISO 20022, ERC-3643, permissioned transfers, reconciliation, settlement evidence, stablecoin (whitelisted), escrow, audit-ready.

**What:** A fixed-income note where cash settles on **regulated rails** (escrow at a licensed institution or—where permitted—whitelisted stablecoins). A **permissioned token** is the **register & distribution** layer.  
**Why:** Make private debt programmable & auditable without pretending payments are on-chain.

---

## TL;DR

- **Instrument:** `FixedIncomeNote` (ERC-20-like supply = face value units; **ERC-3643-compatible**, permissioned transfers).  
- **Issuance:** **Delivery-versus-Payment (DvP)** only — mint/transfer **after** verified settlement evidence.  
- **Servicing:** Coupons/redemptions wired off-chain; **on-chain events** carry `settlementRef` / `settlementNetwork` for deterministic reconciliation to statements or tx hashes.

## The KBB story (2-minute read)

**KBB = Kartvelian Business Bonds.** A path for Georgian SMEs to access "**Eurobond-like**" financing sized for small/mid tickets: standardized terms, predictable servicing, and professional investors — with operational truth on **regulated cash rails** and a tokenized **register & distribution** layer for transparency and control.

- **Who benefits:**  
  • SMEs with real revenue that lack efficient cross-border credit routes.  
  • Professional allocators who want predictable coupons and audit-ready trails.  
  • Operators (issuer/transfer agent) who need DvP discipline and clean reconciliations.

> **Design principle:** **Cash settles on regulated rails.** Tokens exist to **register ownership, gate eligibility/lockups, and emit machine-readable lifecycle events** keyed to the same references used by banking or (where permitted) stablecoin rails.

## Architecture at a glance

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  I[Investor (eligible)] -->|Subscribe| E(Escrow at regulated institution)
  E -->|Settlement advice / proof| A[Settlement Adapter]
  A -->|attest (amount,currency,valueDate,settlementRef,network)| O[DvP Orchestrator]
  O -->|mint/transfer if funded| N((FixedIncomeNote))
  N -->|events incl. settlementRef| L[On-chain Event Log]
  L -->|refs| A
```

**Core flows**

* **Primary (DvP):** Investor funds on a supported rail → adapter attests → orchestrator settles → `SubscriptionSettled(...)` with the same reference identifiers.
* **Servicing:** Escrow wires coupons/redemptions → token emits `CouponPaid(...)` / `RedemptionPaid(...)` including identical references → deterministic recon.

## Event schema (rail-agnostic)

```text
SubscriptionSettled(orderId, investor, amount, currency, settlementRef, settlementNetwork)
CouponPaid(periodId, grossAmount, withholding, netAmount, settlementRef, settlementNetwork)
RedemptionPaid(amount, settlementRef, settlementNetwork)

settlementNetwork: e.g., "ISO20022" | "SWIFT" | "SEPA" | "ACH" | "FPS" | "ONCHAIN_STABLECOIN"
```

**Accrual (ACT/360, example)**

```text
accrual = notional × (couponRateBps / 10_000) × (days / 360)
```

## Repo map

```text
contracts/  -> Solidity stubs (compiles): FixedIncomeNote, DayCount, interfaces
test/       -> one passing Foundry test (keeps CI green early)
ops/        -> DvP & reconciliation stubs (no heavy deps; TS/Py-ready)
docs/       -> 1-page architecture overview (rail-agnostic)
assets/     -> diagrams (Mermaid)

```bash

*(Optional ops stubs)*

```bash
npm install

### 5-minute demo

```bash
./scripts/demo.sh   # builds & tests contracts, runs rail-agnostic reconciliation
```

## Why this MVP matters

* **Operational truth:** DvP & reconciliation are core, not bolted on.
* **Eligibility by default:** Permissioned transfers; lockups/jurisdictions enforceable at the token seam.
* **Audit-ready:** Event fields mirror the same identifiers rails use (e.g., ISO 20022 `MsgId/UETR`) for deterministic joins.

---

## How to collaborate

* **Contribute a slice:** small PR + one test.
* **Add a rail adapter:** parse evidence → produce `(amount, currency, valueDate, settlementRef, settlementNetwork)`.
* **Challenge mechanics:** invariants, rounding, record dates, failure paths.

See `VISION.md` for intent and `ROADMAP.md` for next checkpoints.
