# KBB Protocol â€” MVP (skeleton)

> Placeholder README for structure discovery.  
> Why: Provide a clear map of the codebase before adding logic, so auditors/partners can navigate.

## What you'll find here
- **contracts/**: Solidity layout (core, interfaces, upgrades, mocks, tests)
- **ops/**: Off-chain orchestration (DvP) and ISO 20022 reconciliation placeholders
- **docs/**: Architecture, threat model, and runbooks (stubs)
- **assets/**: Mermaid diagrams (skeletons)

> All files currently contain **comments only** to avoid CI/security noise.  
> Replace stubs incrementally; add CI only after the first green tests.
