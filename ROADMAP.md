# KBB Phased Roadmap (Regulatory + Macro Lens)

**Purpose:** Show how KBB fits Georgia's financial architecture, how regulation and infrastructure co-evolve, and what signals this sends to external actors.  
**Audience:** NBG, host banks/brokers, DFIs, macro/fin-reg stakeholders, and KBB/AKALabs operators.

## Conceptual frame: tokenised SME debt in a small open economy
- Georgia is bank-dominated with shallow capital markets and strong central-bank control; tokenisation here is a state-aligned modernization of credit intermediation, not a crypto play.  
- Objective: make SME credit transparent, standardised, and tradable while keeping prudential control, AML integrity, and political legitimacy.  
- Macro gap: global capital seeks EM yields; SMEs need term credit; existing pipes (bank balance sheets + thin bond market) are inefficient. Tokenised SME notes, if legally orthodox and technologically modern, create a new intermediation layer between conservative banking regulation and experimental capital markets.

## Phase 1 - Pilot as institutional learning device
- **KBB role:** A supervised "lab inside the system." Each instrument is a Georgian-law dematerialised SME note/bond governed by ERC-3643; professional investors only; one host bank/broker.  
- **Regulatory stance:** All regulated touchpoints (issuer, registrar, AML/CFT) sit with NBG-supervised entities. DLT is operational infra and audit trail; the registrar's database remains the Official Register. Settlement is fiat-only.  
- **Learning objectives:** Can dematerialised SME securities be issued/serviced on DLT without incidents? Do banks/investors use the transparency (real-time registers) for risk control? Do whitelists/caps reduce AML/CFT burden?  
- **System safeguards:** Sits behind a licensed intermediary, no retail, DLT not yet the legal register; failures can be unwound via the Official Register and supervised institutions. External signal: "digital capital-markets infra," not "crypto jurisdiction."

## Phase 2 - Rail for SME credit intermediation
- **KBB role:** From project to rail. Multiple banks/brokers issue on the same ERC-3643/dematerialised configuration; pooled structures (funds, SPVs, securitisations) diversify risk and relieve bank balance sheets.  
- **Macro effects:**  
  - Capital-market deepening: shift from opaque bilateral loans to observable securities flows with price/information content.  
  - Bank balance-sheet management: enables originate-and-distribute with skin-in-the-game, influencing credit growth and risk-weighting.  
  - Cross-border capital: DFIs and foreign investors allocate into defined SME pools instead of generic bank lines.  
- **External layer:** Wrappers (funds/structured notes) for diaspora/foreign qualified investors keep the direct SME counterparty as an institutional entity; retail protection largely handled under the wrapper's home regime.

## Phase 3 - Institutionalisation and international signalling
- **Legal consolidation:**  
  - DLT register recognition (under NBG criteria) makes the ledger primary market infrastructure; resilience and rectification become system-level concerns.  
  - Virtual-asset carve-out for tokenised financial instruments reduces double regulation and signals separation from speculative crypto.  
- **Monetary/settlement integration:** Digital Lari as a settlement asset for tokenised securities pilots a unified-ledger model: programmable money plus programmable assets, shorter settlement chains, better observability of credit flows, and a bridge to mCBDC "Finternet" experiments.  
- **Regional play and narrative:** Georgian-law tokenised notes for regional issuers via Georgian intermediaries; position Georgia as a supervised tokenised-debt hub. In BIS/IMF/DFI fora, the signal is "regulated tokenised finance in EM," not "perpetual pilot."

## Ultra-condensed checklist
- **KBB:** dematerialised debt securities; behind licensed bank/broker; ERC-3643 enforces eligibility/caps/rectification; Phase 1 = institutional learning with fiat-only settlement and DLT as mirror; Phase 2 = multi-host rail with pools/wrappers and macro-relevant capital flows; Phase 3 = DLT register recognition, Digital Lari DvP, regional issuance.  
- **NBG:** sandbox with caps/reporting and written treatment as securities; graduate to standard infra with enhanced reporting; refine qualified investor criteria; add DLT-register provision and VA carve-out; allow Digital Lari settlement once comfortable; use the platform to project a credible tokenised-finance archetype.
